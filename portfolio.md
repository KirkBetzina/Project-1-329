# This Is My Portfolio Markdown


## Portfolio Description 
I want this portfolio to display my skills in a succinct and fashionable way, without being so complicated that the individuals visiting it want to leave. I value simplistic design, and ease of use.
 prime example would be the portfolio site of *Matt Farely* (https://mattfarley.ca/).

The tools I will be using to complete my website are:

- HTML 
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- shoelace
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Ajax
- Bootstrap (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
- Google 
- Youtube

### Web Components 

- Scroll direction icon
- I would love an impact feature on my cards
- icon carousel

### Website Features

- A guest log book that displays the company icon that visited my site and engages. Then catpures their contact data that way I can reach out in the future.
