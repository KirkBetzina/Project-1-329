# This Is My Portfolio Markdown


## Portfolio Description 
I want this portfolio to display my skills in a succinct and fashionable way without, being so complicated that the individuals visiting it. I value simplistic design, and ease of use.
 prime example would be the portfolio site of *Matt Farely* (https://mattfarley.ca/).

The tools I will be using to complete my website are:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Ajax
- Bootstrap
